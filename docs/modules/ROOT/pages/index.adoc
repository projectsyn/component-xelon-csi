= xelon-csi

xelon-csi is a Commodore component to manage the https://github.com/Xelon-AG/xelon-csi[Xelon CSI driver].

The component supports installing the CSI driver in any namespace.
The component deploys additional rolebindings on OpenShift 4 to allow the CSI driver to use the `privileged` SCC.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Xelon cloud doesn't support volumes which are smaller than 5Gi.

To handle this restriction, the CSI driver will simply not provision PVs for PVCs which are smaller than 5Gi.

The Xelon CSI driver currently doesn't support volume expansion at all.
